Odds table showed for example, 1 point higher in GPA will increase the odds of acceptance more than 120%. 100 points higher in GRE score will increase the odds of acceptance by 2.2%. The better the school is the odds of acceptance is higher.  For example, not in Ranked 2 school will lose about 50% chance to not get accepted.\n"
